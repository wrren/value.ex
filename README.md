# Value

Elixir programmers are almost certainly familiar with the `Enum` package; it provides some incredibly 
useful functions that allow you to manipulate enumerables and they're a match made in heaven for
the pipe operator. `Value` is the equivalent package for singular values. It provides functions for 
manipulating and transforming single values so that you can continue your beautiful function pipeline 
without interruption.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `value` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:value, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
